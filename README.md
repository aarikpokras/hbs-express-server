# Express Handlebars Server
A simple template for full-stack websites using Express Handlebars.

Make sure to run `npm install` in order to install the necessary packages.

## Running
Usually you can run `npm run m` and the server will start.

If that doesn't work, just manually run `node index.js`.

## Ports
To set what port you want the server to listen on, manipulate the PORT environment variable.<br />
For example, for port 8080, run `export PORT=8080` in the shell.

## Other stuff
If you're new to this stuff, it really helps to look at the index.js file. If you just make a directory called `page` or something, it won't show up when the user goes to /page.
